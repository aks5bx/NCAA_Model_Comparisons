# NCAA_Model_Comparisons

## Project Overview
This project seeks to generate simple models that predict the Win/Loss of an NCAA March Madness game. The models in consideration include SVM, xgBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. 

The overall goal is to analyze these four models and determine which types of games are particularly difficult to predict with these types of Machine Learning models. The goal of this project is not to do the best job at predicting March Madness games - instead the goal is to understand what game characteristics present the largest challenge to taming the uncertainty of March Madness. 

## Technology Used 
This project primarily uses python, with a strong reliance on the pandas and scikit-learn packages. 

## Note: this project is currently in progress
